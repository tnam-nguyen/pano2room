    """Torch Grid Sample (default)

    - Uses `torch.nn.functional.grid_sample`
    - By far the best way to sample

    params:
    - img (torch.Tensor): Tensor[B, C, H, W]  or Tensor[C, H, W]
    - grid (torch.Tensor): Tensor[B, 2, H, W] or Tensor[2, H, W]
    - device (int or str): torch.device
    - mode (str): (`bilinear`, `bicubic`, `nearest`)

    returns:
    - out (torch.Tensor): Tensor[B, C, H, W] or Tensor[C, H, W]
        where H, W are grid size

    NOTE: `img` and `grid` needs to be on the same device

    NOTE: `img` and `grid` is somehow mutated (inplace?), so if you need
    to reuse `img` and `grid` somewhere else, use `.clone()` before
    passing it to this function

    NOTE: this method is different from other grid sampling that
    the padding cannot be wrapped. There might be pixel inaccuracies
    when sampling from the boundaries of the image (the seam).

    I hope later on, we can add wrap padding to this since the function
    is super fast.
